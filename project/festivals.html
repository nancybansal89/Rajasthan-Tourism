            <h1>GANGAUR FESTIVAL - 2022</h1>
			
			<p> Dates: 4-5 April </p>

            <p>
                Gangaur is one of the most important festivals in Rajasthan. In some form or the other, it is celebrated all over Rajasthan. 
                “Gan” is a synonym for Lord Shiva & “Gauri” or “Gaur” stands for Goddess Parvati, the heavenly consort of Lord Shiva.
                Gangaur celebrates the union of the two and is a symbol of conjugal & marital happiness. 
                Gangaur is celebrated in the month of Chaitra (March-April), the first month of the Hindu calendar. 
                This month marks the end of winter & the onset of spring. This festival is celebrated especially by women, who worship clay idols of “Gan” & “Gauri” in their houses. 
                These idols are worshipped by unmarried girls who seek the blessings of Gan & Gauri for a good husband, while the married women pray for the good health and long life of their husbands. 
                This worship which starts from the first day of the chaitra month culminates on the 18th day into Gangaur festival with a great religious fervor. 
                On the eve of Gangaur festival, women decorate their palms and fingers with henna. The idols of Gan and Gauri are immersed in a pond or in a nearby lake on the last day of the festival. A traditional procession of Gangaur commences form the Zanani-Deodhi of the City Palace, passing through Tripolia Bazaar, Chhoti Chaupar, Gangauri Bazaar, Chaugan stadium and finally converges near the Talkatora. 
                The procession is headed by a colorful pageantry of old palanquins, chariots, bullock carts and performing folk artists.

              Dussehra is a Hindu festival celebrated all over the country. As the name suggests, it is the ‘Tenth Day’ of the fierce battle fought; when Lord Rama killed King Ravana. 
              This holy day marks the victory of good over evil. The Dussehra Festival of Kota is quite a unique experience for both, the residents and tourists. 
              Villagers dress themselves in colourful traditional wear and join long processions to offer their prayers to Lord Rama. Cultural programmes are organised and include scintillating performances by well-known artists. 
              However, the highlight of the festivities is the theatrical representation of the encounter popularly known as ‘Ramleela’. 
              The drama is so highly anticipated among the locals that spectators start chanting the name of Lord Rama during the show. 
              The climax of the show holds most appeal as it ends with setting alight gigantic effigies of the 10-headed Ravana along with his brother Kumbhkarana and his son Meghnath. 
              These 75-feet tall statues are stuffed with crackers and once set on fire, they burst to create an extravagant show.
