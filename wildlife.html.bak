		  <h3>Desert National Park</h3>
		  <p>Desert National Park, located 40 km from Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, is counted as the largest park in the state of Rajasthan. This area offers to be
		  exemplary in its contrasting image of being a barren desert ecosystem and at the same time being home to a plethora of migratory birds.<br>

		  among the many that migrate to this area. <br>

		  wildlife thriving in very harsh conditions, and getting to know and spending time amidst the beauty of a very different and harsh nature.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>Desert National Park is extensively covered by sand dunes over large extents. There are ancient lake beds of salt lakes that used to exist long times 
		  ago in this part. <br>
		  They are filled with thorny shrubs and the topography of the region hence mostly seems to be unlivable and uninhabitable by flora and fauna.<br>
		  However flora and fauna of different kinds are found to flourish in this region in various seasons, though they are mostly found in the winter season. The best
		  time to visit this place would be the winters and early spring, from the month of November to March. This is the time when the maximum numbers of migratory birds 
		  visit this area.</p>

		  <p>The best way to get a real feel of the wilderness of this place is by travelling in a Jeep safari, and going into the deserted areas. Wildlife can be extensively 
		  spotted.<br> Many tourists also enjoy camping here to spend a considerable amount of time in reading nature, or spending a thrilling time around bonfires. It is an exciting 
		  and invigorating experience to be able to visit this place, and take in nature in one of its most unusual and ruthlessly beautiful forms.</p>
