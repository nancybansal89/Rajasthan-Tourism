            <h3>Hawa Mahal</h3>
        
            <p>The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red and pink sandstone, 
              the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, 
              Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.

              The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh,
               who was the founder of the city of Jaipur, India. He was so inspired by the unique structure
               the of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace.
              
              It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small windows 
              called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.[2] The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to 
              observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules of "purdah", 
              which forbade them to appear in public without face coverings. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to 
              pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer. Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street
               view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the back.</p>

            <h3>Amber Fort</h3>
        
            <p>Amber Palace aka Amber Fort was constructed in 1592 AD by Raja Man Singh,
               the Rajput commander of Akbar's army.
               Later it was expanded and renovated by Raja Jai Sigh I.
               Situated at a distance of 11 km from the city, it carries the pride of Jaipur.
    
         
             There are various other buildings within these courtyards i.e., 
             Palace of Man Singh I, Garden, Tripolia gate, Lion gate, Diwan-I-Aam, Sheesh Mahal, Sukh Mahal, etc. 
             Jaipur trip is incomplete without visiting the light show at this grand fort.
             This palace, along with Jaigarh Fort, is located immediately above on the Cheel ka Teela (Hill of Eagles)
              of the same Aravalli range of hills. The palace and Jaigarh Fort are considered one complex, as the two are 
              connected by a subterranean passage. This passage was meant as an escape route in times of war to enable the
               royal family members and others in the Amer Fort to shift to the more redoubtable Jaigarh Fort.</p>

                 <h3>Nahargarh Fort</h3>
                 <p> 
                   Nahargarh Fort, situated on the outskirts of Jaipur, is known for breathtaking views of the city and
                   for its extended wall that connects it to Jaigarh Fort. Embellished with delicate carvings and stonework, 
                    the Nahargarh Fort in Rajasthan is an impregnable structure. The Padao Restaurant is also a must-visit
                   if you're near Nahargarh Fort from where you're sure to enjoy a panoramic view of the city of Jaipur.
                   Built mainly in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the king of Jaipur, the fort was constructed as a place 
                   of retreat on the summit of the ridge above the city. Walls extended over the surrounding hills, forming fortifications
                    that connected this fort to Jaigarh, the fort above the old capital of Amber. Though the fort never came under attack during
                     the course of its history, it did see some historical events, notably, the treaties with the Maratha forces who warred with 
                     Jaipur in the 18th century. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857, the Europeans of the region, including the British Resident's
                      wife, were moved to Nahargarh fort by the king of Jaipur, Sawai Ram Singh, for their protection.
